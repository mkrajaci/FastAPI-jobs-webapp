# Jobs Web App

This App presents how it would look like the FastAPI backend written with API first approach.

I used a fantastic tutorial to get all bits and pieces together, so a special shoutout to devs at [fastapitutorial.com](https://www.fastapitutorial.com/aboutus/).

I covered most of the backend with teste and made it with TDD in my mind to learn how to implement tests in the FastAPI backend.

I used [SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for all DB manipulation and managed dependencies and packages with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

For the frontend part, I used [Jinja templating engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) with some help from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
